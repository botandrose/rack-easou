Handle Invalid Percent Encoding Requests
=======================================

Rails Engine that renders 400 error whenever a request's
percent-encoding is malformed.

This happens notably a lot for the chinese [EasouSpider](http://www.easou.com/search/spider.html).

Install
-------

In your Rails app, add this line to your `Gemfile`:

```rb
gem "rack-easou"
```

Then type `bundle`.
